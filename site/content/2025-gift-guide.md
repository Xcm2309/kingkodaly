{{< figure src="/giftguide.png" alt="2025 Gift Guide" class="figure-center" >}}

Have you ever wondered what to get that nerdy guy in your life who also has an old money style?
Well this is the gift guide for you!

## Watches

Every man needs a good watch, so why not get him one for the holidays?
A good entry point can be the retro [Casio F91W](https://www.amazon.com/Casio-F91W-1-Classic-Resin-Digital/dp/B000GAWSDG?th=1).
If you're looking for something bigger, the [Tissot PRX Powermatic 80](https://www.amazon.com/Tissot-PRX-Powermatic-80-40mm/dp/B0DCWXJM74/ref=sims_dp_d_dex_ai_rank_model_1_d_v1_d_sccl_1_7/130-5771532-0501639?pd_rd_w=mJXxF&content-id=amzn1.sym.da0b205c-8cc7-4a8d-9d0a-8ed3705890a2&pf_rd_p=da0b205c-8cc7-4a8d-9d0a-8ed3705890a2&pf_rd_r=1NRAP70KVK146XJDJ1PB&pd_rd_wg=p6spB&pd_rd_r=dce7b087-285e-49cf-a5d8-d1f44c484667&pd_rd_i=B0DCWXJM74&psc=1) and the [Hamilton Khaki Field Auto](https://www.hamiltonwatch.com/en-us/h70515137-khaki-field-auto.html) are good choices too.
The right watch for someone is a personal choice, so try and see if they have any strong feelings before getting it.

## Watch Straps

If you already know someone is into watches, it may be good to get them a strap as a new way to style their old watch.
Most watch companies also manutfacture straps, so if you know they have a specific type of watch, you could get them a strap from that brand.
There are many different strap types such as [NATO straps](https://www.hamiltonwatch.com/en-us/h6006941021-green-nato-strap-20mm.html),
[leather straps](https://www.hamiltonwatch.com/en-us/h6003241161-black-strap-20mm.html), or
[rubber straps](https://www.hamiltonwatch.com/en-us/h6008231031-rubber-strap-20mm.html).
Make sure to get an appropriately sized strap for their watch!

## Catch Alls

When you get in the door, its always nice to have a place to put your keys and wallet down.
Then they're always in the same place when you're ready to head out the door.
This [merino wool tray](https://graflantz.com/collections/tray/products/large-kawabon-heather-black-felt-leather-tray?variant=39663542403181)
or a [leather one](https://www.markandgraham.com/products/monogrammed-rustic-leather-catchall/?srsltid=AfmBOoqjZnFbcuEpPjU7BMrPKxuCn1RVbko9AxaMXWLNbYL08zSyEiIx)
could be a good option.

## Sunglasses
Even in the winter, sunglasses are great to have for those cold but sunny days.
A pair of [American Optical Saratoga sunglasses](https://aoeyewear.com/product/saratoga/?frame+color=Matte+Tortoise)
can give old money vibes as they were famously worn by JFK.

## Orbitkey Key Organizer
I've recently started using the [Orbitkey key organizer pro](https://www.orbitkey.com/collections/key-organiser-pro/products/key-organiser-pro?variant=41276830548064)
with the [multitool v2](https://www.orbitkey.com/collections/accessories/products/multi-tool-v2)
and have found it a useful and fun way to store my keys.
This combo could make a great gift for someone interested in optimizing their every day carry.

## Books
Who doesn't love a new book?
Books can be great gifts, especially if you know the recipient is a reader.
When choosing a book to gift them, keep in mind their hobbies and interests.
Perhaps they have a Goodreads account with a list of books they've already read or ones they're interested in reading.
If you want to get them a nicer copy of a book, publishers such as
[Easton Press](https://www.eastonpress.com/the-classics/the-odyssey-of-homer-3998054.html) and
[The Folio Society](https://www.foliosociety.com/usa/the-master-and-margarita) provide great editions.

## Polos
Polos provide a great middle point between business and casual and therefore make a great gift for anyone.
My favorite polo has been the [J. Crew pique polo](https://www.jcrew.com/plp/mens/categories/clothing/tshirts-and-polos?fabric=Cotton%20Pique,Washed%20Pique)
but I have been interested in trying some by [Polo Ralph Lauren](https://www.macys.com/shop/brands/ralph-lauren/polo-ralph-lauren-mens-clothing/ralph-lauren-mens-shirts/Product_department/Polo%20Shirts?id=238021#canvas).
Make sure to get a tall size if they're above 6'0" for the proper fit!

## Wool Blankets
Nothing is better than cozying up with a nice wool blanket on a cold winter night.
Therefore, a wool blanket is a great Christmas gift for anyone.
A wool throw from [Faribault Mill](https://www.faribaultmill.com/products/santa-fe-wool-throw-blanket?pr_prod_strat=jac&pr_rec_id=d40240247&pr_rec_pid=6631343816813&pr_ref_pid=4750436630637&pr_seq=uniform)
or [Pendleton](https://www.pendleton-usa.com/product/schoolhouse-x-pendleton-abington-hall-throw/78979Z.html?dwvar_78979Z_color=57405)
are true "buy it for life" items!

## EDC (Everyday Carry) Essentials
Every guy is always in search of the perfect EDC kit.
Items such as multitools, pocket knives and flashlights can always find a place in an EDC set up or in a back up kit for the car.
Multitools like the [Victorniox Fieldmaster](https://www.victorinox.com/en-US/Products/Swiss-Army-Knife%E2%84%A2-and-Tools/Outdoor/Fieldmaster/p/1.4713)
or the [Leatherman Bond](https://www.leatherman.com/products/bond?variant=43009459388509),
or flashlights like the [Olight ArcPro](https://www.olight.com/store/arkpro-series-flat-edc-flashlight) are fan favorites.
There is no shortage of content around good EDC gear to find other suggestions.

## Teenage Engineering Pocket Operator
The [Teenage Engineering Pocket Operator](https://teenage.engineering/products/po) is a fun little drum machine and a great gift for someone who loves creating their own music.
There are a number of different ones to get, each with a unique sound bank and different features.
They can be chained together so even if they already have one, another would still be a great gift!
